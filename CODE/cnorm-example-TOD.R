# Alex Lenhard's recommended approach

# Use the all-in-one cnorm() function to create the model.
# Compare diagnostics from two approaches to defining age groups: -
# 1. use getGroups() to create equal size groups out of the age distributions,
# use "groups = " argument within cnorm() to refer to column holding this
# grouping code.
# 2. omit group argument: cnorm() defaults to rankBySlidingWindow, but this can
# be problematic when there are few cases on the tails of the age distribution -

# The two key diagnostics are plot(model, "series") and checkConsistency(). Both
# target the same problem: violations of monotonicty, or intersecting percentile
# curves. With plot(model, "series"), you can use "end" argument to set upper
# limit of predictors.
