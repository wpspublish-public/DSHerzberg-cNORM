# against the ss col on the left. The tables in this list preserve the
# (test>>age) hiearchy of the input files, with one look-up row for each
# possible SS value.


# Thus, the initial transformation of
# the work flow is to collapse the incremental sequence of raw scores so that
# each standard score occupies only a single row in the output. Prior to this
# transformation, there could be duplicate standard score rows. To preserve the
# many-to-one raw to SS relationship, any ss row may map onto a range of raw
# scores (e.g., 88-91)

# age_strat_cols_ta is a transformation of print_lookup_list using nested map
# calls. The table for each test of print_look_up_list is broken down into
# separate look-up dfs, one for each age_strat col. So age_strat_cols_ta is a
# list of lists, the top level being a list for each test, and the lower level
# being the list of age-strat specific lookup tables within each test. We say
# that the (test>>age) hierarchy of the input is preserved here, because the
# lowest level col labels are age-strat labels, as they are on the input files.

age_test_cols_flat <- flatten(age_strat_cols_ta) %>%

# age_test_cols_at reconstitutes a new two-level list from the flattened
# as_tn_dfs. Whereas in age_strat_cols_ta, the hierarchy was test --> age_strat,
# in age_test_cols_at, that hierarchy is reversed to age_strat --> test, which
# is the hierarchy required for the final output. Now we have a list of lists in
# which the top level is a list for each age_strat, and within those lists are
# the list of lookup tables for that age_strat, for all six tests. This
# transformation is accomplished via purrr::keep(), which subsets list elements.
# Using map(), we subset age_test_cols_flat 9 times, mapping across the 9
# elements of age_strat. str_detect() matches the pattern supplied by .x (here a
# particular age_strat) against the names of the flattened age_test_cols_flat,
# and returns list elements whose names contain a match for the the pattern
# (i.e., a particular age-strat). These retained elements are complete sets of
# test-specific lookup columns, one set for each agestrat, giving the new
# two-level list the desired output hierarchy (age_strat --> test).

# print_lookups_at is a transformation of age_test_cols_at into a list suitable
# for writing out as a tabbed .xlsx file. Recall that each element of
# age_test_cols_at is a list of the test-wise look up dfs for each
# age_strat. reduce() joins the list of dfs into a single df with right-ward raw
# score lookup cols for each test within each age_strat. The call of rename_with
# renames the raw score cols of the newly joined dfs, taking advantage of a
# shorthand in which the renaming function (the first argument of rename_with is
# specified as the vector or new) is simple a vector containing the new col
# names, and the second argument is a vector of equal length naming the cols to
# be renamed (here those cols are collected using the tidy select helper
# contains()). We then name the nine new age-strat specific lookup tables with
# the names of their corresponding age_strats, using set_names. Naming the list
# elements here is crucial for output, as these names become the tabbed names on
# the .xlsx output file.
